  <p>My name is Rashid Dar, and I am a currently a Program Officer for Global Strategies at the <a href="http://templeton.org">John Templeton Foundation</a>(JTF). Given my focus on Islam, what I do in a nutshell at JTF is to help amplify the important work Muslims all around the world are doing to define and live out their religion in a positive, rather than negative way, i.e. giving Muslims the tools and resources to show what Islam <i>is</i> or could/should be, rather than what it isn't. In the post 9/11 landscape, Muslims have spent too much time on the latter, to the detriment the former. Given that the bulk of my focus lies in the Foundation's Islam-related investments in the majority-Muslim world, I am often found traveling.</p>
<p>Prior to this role, I worked as a researcher focusing on political Islam at the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu">Brookings Institution</a> in Washington, DC. Before that, I was part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_II_diplomacy">Track II</a> initiative trying to bring calm to the Syrian Civil War. I attended Columbia University (<a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/">SIPA</a>, MIA 2015) the University of Wisconsin - Madison (<a href="http://ls.wisc.edu/">L&S</a>, BA 2011), and <a href="http://darulqasim.org">Darul Qasim</a>. Between work and family, I do my best to study traditional Islam as a Muslim <i>qua</i> Muslim.
