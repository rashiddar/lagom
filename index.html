  <h2><i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> about | عني </h2>
  <p>My name is Rashid Dar, and I am a currently Program Officer for Global Strategies at the John Templeton Foundation, which is dedicated to pioneering research at the frontiers and intersections of religion, science, philosophy, and other questions of modern importance. There, I work within a number of several funding buckets, but the bulk of my focus lies in the Foundation's Islam-related investments in the majority-Muslim world. I am thus often traveling.</p>
<p>Prior to this role, I worked as a researcher focusing on political Islam at the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu">Brookings Institution</a> in Washington, DC. Before that, I was part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_II_diplomacy">Track II</a> initiative trying to bring calm to the Syrian Civil War. I attended Columbia University (<a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/">SIPA</a>, MIA 2015) the University of Wisconsin - Madison (<a href="http://ls.wisc.edu/">L&S</a>, BA 2011), and <a href="http://darulqasim.org">Darul Qasim</a>. Between work and family, I do my best to study traditional Islam as a Muslim <i>qua</i> Muslim.
<p>Below, you'll find my personal blog posts. You can find a list of my outside articles and publications <a href='http://rashiddar.com/publications.html'>here</a>.</p>
