The dead horse that is the annual Muslim debate over moonsighting versus calculations is at this point beyond beaten. The poor guy is at this point a pile of bones, now being grinded into dust.

Are there [multiple opinions](http://musafurber.com/2015/06/06/ramadan-moonfighting-shafi%CA%BFic-calculations/) on the issue? Of course. Am I as a _muqallid_ individual qualified to make a judgment between these issues? No. I simply follow the opinion of authentic scholars whom I trust and have a relationship with. This has, for me, meant that I am on #TeamMoonsighting. 

The legal debate, then, isn't going to be settled anytime soon. But setting that completely aside for a moment, I want to make the case that there is another, more philosophical reason to hold fast to moonsighting.

section on disenchantment

According to the Stanford En

> Rational action in one very general sense presupposes knowledge. It requires some knowledge of the ideational and material circumstances in which our action is embedded, since to act rationally is to act on the basis of conscious reflection about the probable consequences of action. As such, the knowledge that underpins a rational action is of a causal nature conceived in terms of means-ends relationships, aspiring towards a systematic, logically interconnected whole. Modern scientific and technological knowledge is a culmination of this process that Weber called intellectualization, in the course of which, the germinating grounds of human knowledge in the past, such as religion, theology, and metaphysics, were slowly pushed back to the realm of the superstitious, mystical, or simply irrational. It is only in modern Western civilization, according to Weber, that this gradual process of disenchantment (Entzauberung) has reached its radical conclusion.

Yes, moonsighting can be onerous. Yes, you may not be able to tell your boss in advance what day you need off, or when your kid might need to be taken out of school. Or maybe, one part of your extended family insists on following calculations, dividing you down the middle. But these are small issues, almost all of which have workarounds and are of little consequence. 

By embracing these small annoyances, one gains so much in return. A chance to connect with that luminous moon Allah has placed in the heavens above, which proclaims and exalts His holy name at all times in all states. A feeling of anticipation and joy when the moon is finally sighted. A night of excitement as the first jama'ah of tarawÄ«h is hastily assembled at the masjid. 

Honor this process. The world has enough disenchantment as it is.
